# Verification — 2026-10-05

Automated checks: 20 tests passing; production build passing.

Fixed and reproduced:
- Duplicate subtask names reused the same ID after editing, so checking one checked both. Each occurrence now keeps a distinct ID and its completion state. Verified in the browser and covered by two regression tests.
- Resuming a timer could display one second less until the next clock tick. Elapsed time now clamps the sampled running interval to zero; covered by a regression test.

Browser verification in local demo:
- All eight main menu pages rendered at 1280px desktop and 390 x 844 mobile; no document horizontal overflow detected.
- Task creation, editing, independent subtasks, completion, and confirmed deletion.
- Count habit stayed in position after partial increment, then moved to the bottom when complete.
- Note creation, search, edit, and persistence after reload.
- Overnight schedule split between Monday and Tuesday; one-hour budget on each day. A conflicting Tuesday interval was rejected.
- Stopwatch start, pause, persisted paused state after reload, resume, and save.
- Profile mobile layout, canceling photo dialog, profile-to-settings edit-account link, and mobile More navigation.
- At 320px, the habit weekday buttons stayed on one row and the last Habit Ideas category scrolled fully into view.
- Mobile add controls are 52px circles with a 16px gap above the bottom navigation on all six applicable pages.
- JSON backup downloaded and imported successfully. Only this run's QA-1005 records were removed with user authorization. Exported final data matched the normalized retained backup exactly; no QA-1005 records remain.
- Fresh verification tab had no console errors or warnings on the dashboard.

Limitations:
- Supabase URL and key are unset locally. Live Auth, email delivery, password changes, RLS isolation, and cross-device cloud sync remain unverified.
- Mobile checks used a browser viewport; physical mobile Safari/Chrome remains unverified.
- Deployed hosting, background notifications, and a full timed Pomodoro/break cycle were not tested in this browser run. The duration and midnight-splitting logic is covered by automated tests.
